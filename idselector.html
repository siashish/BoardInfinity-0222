        <p>Wikis are enabled by wiki software, 
            otherwise known as wiki engines. 
            A wiki engine, being a form of a 
            content management system, differs 
            from other web-based systems such 
            as blog software, in that the content 
            is created without any defined owner 
            or leader, and wikis have little 
            inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge </p>
