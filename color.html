        <p style="background-color: tomato;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
             industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
              ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
              type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
              survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
               typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
               in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
               Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
               like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
